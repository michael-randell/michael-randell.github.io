Hello readers :) 

So...Why do I want to be a web developer? For me, that's a loaded question to answer fully because I have many reasons why I chose to take this path. It was a major decision that I had to think through and consider a multitude of factors. I will try my best to sum this up with two or three of my main factors!

To start with, I will put it quite simply. Computers and all the sub fields within this profession/discipline are the FUTURE, as we all know. Going into this field is a no brainer when it comes to thinking about future opportunities that we can see at the moment, along with the exciting unknown ones that will come as innovation and technology progresses and expands. 

Now, my second key point is more personal and is to do with how I see myself fitting into this discipline. So, a little bit about me. I'm 24 years old at this point and I have been searching and searching and searching for what I want to do career-wise for about seven years, pretty much obsessively. For some reason though, through all these years, I never even considered coding, I really don't know why but I just didn't. So finally, I started doing some reseach and learning and the first time I got one of my more involved coding challenge working after a lot of effort and time, something clicked. Right after, I had dinner with my parents and I told them, "woah, I think I've actually found what I want to do." I will always remember that moment and many others that followed in that first couple weeks of being introduced. I had finally found my thing. I still use those moments that I get to remind me to keep pushing through this learning process when things get tough. So when it comes to coding, this is what I want to do.


A sub point, adding onto my second point....A big thing for me is I really love having something to put my mind towards, something to really focus on and get better at. I am able to channel my obsessive tendencies through it. That's the truth, coding seems to channel that force within me perfectly. When I was younger, I used to play basketball. For a good few years, in my prime (haha) I used to shoot 500 shots a day, practicing for hours on end. Now, I feel like I have found my next goal. 

Thanks for reading!
