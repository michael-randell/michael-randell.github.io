So, this is what we're all here for, coding! As for me, I have been continuing forward with the expansion of my skillset, which is actually probably the most important part of this job hunt stage in the process. I have stayed on top of this with basically half of my daily routine being devoted to coding and review. A couple of my activities at the moment include a JavaScript project where I am building a simon game application and solving JS and Ruby puzzle and algorithm problems to sharpen and improve my problem solving. 

I am steadily getting better with the puzzle challeneges but as for this blog post, I will focus on one of my successes I had in developing my simon game app. I beleive it was on Thursday, I was coding, going through the next step in the project where I was implementing the functionality for flashing an error button and starting a new game when the wrong button was pressed in the pattern. I had no problem with making this work but I got to the next step and came across a JavaScript situation I never enocuntered before, dealing with a click event on an element firing twice. The solution was to unbind the event listener. Now, the part that was most impactful to me was that, while trying to think about what could possibly be happening, the answer felt like it came to me in an intuitive way and it ended up being the exact solution to the problem. While this may seem like pretty simple solution, for me, it really was one of those moments where everything clicked and I realized I am a Web Developer, junior developer maybe but anyways, this experience gave me a bit of a confidence boost which I think we, as developers, can use once in a while. 

My other coding sucess this week was fully implementing AWS S3 into my Williams Rails & Angular application to handle the uploading and storing of my image files. I have never used Amazon Web Services S3 past the basics so I wanted to learn how to. This laid a good foundation for me to continue growing on for sure.

Anyways, going with the flow and on to week 4!
