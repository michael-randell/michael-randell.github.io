So, at this point I have finished my Sinatra Project! I now feel like I am ready and prepared to start my assessment. Which is something I definitely couldn't of said a little over a week ago. 

As I said in my last blog, I am back into the program full force going on about 3 weeks now, after my month hiatus. In my return, I realized quickly that I had forgot a good few things about the ins and outs of Sinatra. So it took some inital days of review and frustration to spark my Sinatra brain back up again. Those first few days were a bit rough, right in the middle to end part of the track was definitely not the best place to have to break for a month but I just kept going forward and now I can say I'm extremely happy I did!

It went a bit like this...I came back to the ActiveRecord in Sinatra lesson/lab and continued all the way through to the end of the ActiveRecord section and hit my most major challenge, the Sinatra Playlister lab. I definitely struggled with this one big time because I was supposed to put everything together. I had to do a lot of research and going back through prior lessons to scrape through this one but eventually I was able to pass all the tests and hit the learn submit. Relief. 

Then, the Sinatra NYC lab! It was an absolute breeze after all that I went through with Playlister. It took me about a day to finish and I was just flying through it, test by test. My confidence was at an all time high. That feeling when you know you're learning and actually absorbing is just great, I absolutely love it. I have had these moments over and over again on Learn. As I've said before, the curriculum is just top notch!

Then came 'Sinatra Project Mode'. To begin with, I was a bit intimidated. Then, after I finished up Fwitter, which came with some challeneges/learning opportunities ;) I realized again, that I need to stop psyching myself out before I even start. When it came down to it, I completed Fwitter pretty easily. Everything was clicking on all gears at this point and I was hyped up to make my first Sinatra Project from the bottom up.

I have been getting into freediving lately, also known as Apnea. So, I realized right off the bat that this was a good way to go with my project. I was to make a Apnea time/distance tracker app that would keep track of individual divers and static times/dynamic distances, mental states, and experience, just like a training log. This project ended up being one of if not the most enjoyable programming experience I've had so far because up until this point I haven't really built anything that is 100% my creation. This one gave me the reigns to do almost whatever I wanted, so I was interested in this for sure. 

Slowly but surely, step by step, piece by piece, it all came together nicely and I'm pretty proud of it! I feel like if I really wanted to, I could use it right now in my own apnea practice. I will definitely make improvements on it in the future when I learn more and more.

I couldn't be more satisfied with my learning progress on Learn right now. Onward!
