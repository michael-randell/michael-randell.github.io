Wow! The things you can learn through working your way through a project. These projects, while being the most challenging parts of the course, are by far the most valuable. Being able to put together the pieces learned through each track really consolidates everything in a more concrete way in a sense of the big picture . Then add in the obstacles that inevitably pop up along the way of the coding process and you've got a great way to learn the skill of web development in all it's aspects. 

When I first set out on this journey, I heard and read advice saying to just make something and today, if I were to give my own advice, I'd suggest doing the same.

In this project, seemingly moreso than the others, I learned about the about development process. I think partly due to the project being the endpoint of two tracks together, the Javascript and Rails + Javascript sections. Then on top of that, using the Rails project itself to implement new features with JS, Ajax, a backend API, etc...It was a challenging one because on top of this, I was forced to take a absence from Learn the week right after I finished the track materials. Leaving a bit of time for my memory to go a bit stale on some concepts.  So, I started the project on a bit of a lull, which ended up being valuable to me in the end.

To make explaining my experience simple, I started off with a lot of frustration, making many guesses and putting myself in a self-created infinite loop that I'm sure many developers experience. I would be stuck at points because I simply hadn't really identified the problem in the first place. This being an obviously very important and first step in solving a problem. Among other things I realized along the way, a second major thing I saw in myself was the tendency to get a little overwhelmed when I felt like I was at a dead end, which went along with my first issue. The importance of not getting stuck at this point is crucial and a nicely timed ten minute break can in many cases solve the problem. Getting out of a perspective of a problem that is wrong and coming back with a fresh view is so, so important. 

One last thing I learned is to never give up because here I am at the end of the week with the project submitted and my Rails app looking fresh with a couple new features. All the problems I struggled with are solved and I finished. That's something to keep in mind.
