The hyped-up, almighty Rails porfolio project. I'll be honest here, I was absolutely intimidated going into this. All along, I heard classmate stories in Thoughtful Thursdays and typed up on Slack about how they're in the thick of the Rails project, most of the time exclaiming their struggles and frustrations. I was back working through Sinatra with the thought of the Rails project lingering out there somewhere in the background. Might have been bad timing for me but I heard story after story, no exagerration. 

Anyways, I pulled right up to the project after hitting a nice stride at the end of the Rails curriculum. I came in feeling pretty confident because Rails was overall going smoothly for me throughout the whole section. I made sure through doing multiple reviews of certain concepts I had trouble with intially that I was well prepared to tackle the project head on and while a blank, unconfigured app is always a little bit unsettling, I did know that the potential is always there for a full blown app, feature, or whatever you're looking at building. The potential is always there as long as you take the right approach, or when it comes to coding, approaches! I decided to start with the view of just going step by step, piece by piece, google search by google search. I kept moving through the project and eventually I was finding it easy, I was even trying to go out of my way to make it a bit more challenging at points. Through it all, I learned all sorts of new things and saw how all the pieces fit together in a more whole way which solidified all the little things for me. The Rails project was completed and the whole process was a success for me on this learning journey!

In the end, I realized that is at least %50 of what coding and learning comes down to, another %20 is probably just not giving up. 

It's easy and natual to get a bit overwhelmed sometimes, but with the right approach, anything can be learnt and built. In code, as in life.
