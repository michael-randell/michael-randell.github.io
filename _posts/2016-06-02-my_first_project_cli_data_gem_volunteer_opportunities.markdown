  Hello again blog readers! 
  
  Today, I am going to continue to update on my feelings a progress through the Learn.co program so far and my thoughts on my first project, the CLI Data Gem. 

  Well, it's been another month since my last post and I can surly say that this is the best learning experience I have ever had. I have steadily been putting in the effort everyday and the curriculum is guiding me in way that is challenging but also reinforces old material. Along with going back to review, the steady progression from lesson to lesson is working great for me. I feel like I am learning and absorbing in an optimal way. A lot of the real learning comes in the phase where we recall information that we studied or read prior. Hitting that part where you have a moment of recalling something, really makes it settle in. 
  
  So, as for the CLI Data Gem, I definitely struggled a little bit to begin with and it was a challenge but I was up for it. A lot of my struggle came from just psyching myself out about it though, seeing a bunch of blank files can be intimidating but Avi had some good advice. It was to just continue making progress, whether with pseudo code or dumby code, whatever to make things progress, little steps. My problem was definitely that I saw the blank files and started thinking about the whole project at once. I have seen that a huge part of this process of learning web development is the approach. You also need the skill and knowledge, of course, but the approach and keeping perspective is probably the most important, to me. So now, whenever I get myself psyched out, I realize that I need to take a step back, or maybe even move away from the computer for ten minutes to refresh. I always seem to come back with a better view and it seems like usually even the answer will just come to me. Overall, once I broke everything up and refeactored my code I looked back at the project and said to myself, "wow, that was actually pretty easy."
  
  So yes! My progress is going well at this point, just going to continue moving forward!
