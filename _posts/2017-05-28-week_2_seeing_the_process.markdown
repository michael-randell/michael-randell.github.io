So! Week 2 has been my first real introduction to this process in full, including giving my first few interviews. Definitely have experienced some ups and downs so far but at this point I realize I'm only just getting my feet wet, things are going to continue getting a bit more involved for sure but this week has been a solid experience for me. I have also been able to refine my process and approach with my advisor Katie, she has given me some advice that has been extremely helpful and valuable, for sure. So, I definitely feel more prepared and aware going forward. 

As far as continuing to expand on my skills, I have made some definite progress on my Simon application which has been a great test and review of some of my JavaScript and jQuery skills which will always be valuable in this field and have continued with my reading of Secrets of The JavaScript Ninja. I have also tweaked some aspects of my projects I am presenting on my portfolio. As far as my next task goes, today I have just begun the process of adding Amazon Web Services (AWS) functionality to my Williams Rails & Angular project. So yes, ever forward into this infinite heaven of learning that is Web Development! Love it.
