Hey guys, just posting my weekly run-down update! Week four was full of activity, I had all sorts of recruiters and companies calling me and at this point, I have 3 solid leads. I also had my first in person interview set up a few days ago which actually ended up being extremely disssapointing. I drove one our south to this company called Hotlets and was scheduled to interview with the owner and sadly what ended up happening was I pulled up into the parking lot and a security guard turned me away, saying that she wasn't there, she wouldn't even let me in the building. It was a pretty big let down for me because the interview was at 3:30 and I was obviously stressing up until that time and spent my some of my time that day preparing and then spent my money driving two hours round trip for someone to not have had a second thought to maybe inform their appointments of the situation. I have tried to contact but I'm not sure if I will be hearing back from this company. To be honest, I might have been saved from getting tangled up in this company by the looks of it but maybe not, who knows, situations do come up and while I am still a bit put off by this, I would understand that. I did send an email saying that I'm still definitely interested and would like to reschedule if possible. So, that was the main story for this week.

As for other news, I have another interview coming up with a company called BIBI Enterprises on Wednesday of next week and also have another couple solid leads which are looking like they will pan out with interviews. I'm very happy with how this week turned out, a lot of my activities are seeming to pay off and things are starting to heat up so I hope next week turns out the same. I'm definitely ready for things to start picking up, so lets go!
