So, I have just about finished the Learn curriculm and now I am getting myself ready to start the next phase of this journey. A major phase which is definitely going to be challenging and will require a lot of focus and most importantly, persistence.

I have definitely had those regular old doubts and questions that come with starting something new and uncertain but when it comes down to it, the conclusion I always come to is that I am ready. The Flatiron/Learn.co program has been so thorough and to put it simply, a great education experience. I definitely have plenty still left to learn as we all do in this field, but I feel like I have a solid foundation under me at this point. I didn't imagine when I started that I would be where I'm now witth this skill. I have the toolbox and many tools, now I just need some projects and challenges to continue improving my work. 


I have many reasons behind me for why I want this. So I will be keeping these in mind. Having a good few reasons as to why you want to achieve a goal goes a long way. As long as I stay focused, do my work, and most importantly stay persistent, I will get to where I want to be and doing what I want to do.
