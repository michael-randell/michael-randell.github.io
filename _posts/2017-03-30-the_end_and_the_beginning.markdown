So, just about finished with Learn and just about to start a whole new phase of this journey! 

TO BE CONTINUED/EDITED

@Wow! The things you can learn through working your way through a project. These projects, while being the most challenging parts of the course, are by far the most valuable. Being able to put together the pieces learned through each track really consolidates everything in a more concrete way in a sense of the big picture . Then add in the obstacles that inevitably pop up along the way of the coding process and you’ve got a great way to learn the skill of web development in all it’s aspects.@
