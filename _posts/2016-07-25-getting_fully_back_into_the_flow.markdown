So, after a brief hiatus from Learn.co because of family circumstances I am back and more excited than ever to get going again!

Now, just to get my rythm back...

I was really rolling nicely before this situation came up, with a set of 5:00 alarms, every morning. It became a routine and an efficient one at that. I am tring my best, slowly but surely to get the habit going again as I am always way more focused and productive in the mornings. There is just something about waking up before the sun while it's still quiet and dark that gets my motivation juices pumping. It makes me feel like I'm going back into training mode, like back in the day when I was up at the crack of dawn starting to get my 500 daily shots up before the blazing Florida sun started peaking. Yes, the neighbors loved me.

So for me, it is crucial to get back going with this consistently. 

During this time away from Learn I continued learning, coding and reviewing so I didn't get completely rusty. One thing I did was I went through with reading a highly recommended book [The Well-Grounded Rubyist](https://www.amazon.com/Well-Grounded-Rubyist-David-Black/dp/1933988657) and found it to be extremely valuable, I definitely feel like I have more of a clear view on how Ruby works now. I'd class this book as a must read. 

I feel like I have a fresh perspective on this process now and I think this hiatus will be beneficial for me in the long-run. At this point, as I said, my main focus is just getting my routine back. 

Thanks for reading! Back to the grind!
